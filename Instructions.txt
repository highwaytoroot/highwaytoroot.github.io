ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS POST 13/10/2019:


In terminal, run:

	gem install bundler
	gem install github-pages

In the folder where you cloned the repo, run:

	jekyll new highwaytoroot.github.io --force
	cd highwaytoroot.github.io

copy and paste in Gemfile the following content:

	source "https://rubygems.org"
	# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
	# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
	# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
	#
	#     bundle exec jekyll serve
	#
	# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
	# Happy Jekylling!

	# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
	gem "minima", "~> 2.5"
	# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
	# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
	gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
	# If you have any plugins, put them here!
	group :jekyll_plugins do
	#  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"
	end

	# Windows and JRuby does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
	# and associated library.
	install_if -> { RUBY_PLATFORM =~ %r!mingw|mswin|java! } do
	  gem "tzinfo", "~> 1.2"
	  gem "tzinfo-data"
	end

	# Performance-booster for watching directories on Windows
	gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.1", :install_if => Gem.win_platform?

Finally, run:

	bundler update					<---- Before start to work, always run this.
	bundler exec jekyll serve       <---- Run always jekyll in this way, it checks whether github dependencies are satisfied or not.
