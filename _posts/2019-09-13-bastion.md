The first thing we have done has been to perform an **Nmap** scan against the target.

<pre>nmap -sS -sV -v -A -p- -oA nmap_tcp_all 10.10.10.134

As it is possible to notice the only interesting ports are SMB ports. For this reason we
tried to use smbmap with guest account, through the following command :

`smbmap -H 10.10.10.134 -u guest -p "" -R`

![](/images/bastion/initial_smb.png)


As it is possible to observe the result is quite interesting because we can freely access to
the Backup folder of the SMB server.
Trying to download large files has revealed to be slow so we tried so we tried to mount
the smb share on our box, using the following command:

`mount //10.10.10.134/Backups ./vhd/ -o user=guest`

Unfortunately the command does not work properly, apparently the File System is CIFS and mount
need a further module, cifs-utils.
After having installed the module, we could access the SMB share running:

`mount //10.10.10.134/Backups ./vhd/ -o user=guest`

Enumerating the share locally, we can notice a WindowsImageBackup folder, which could potentially
contain some interesting backup files. Reaching the following folder WindowsImageBackup/L4mpje-
PC/Backup 2019-02-22 124351 is possible to notice some xml and Windows Disk Image files.

![](/images/bastion/tree_smbshare.png)

The first try is to mount that image file. We need to find a tool which allows us to mount vhd image
files, because Kali doesn't support it natively.

`sudo apt-get install libvhdi-utils sleuthkit
vhdimount 9b9cfbc4-369e-11e9-a17c-806e6f6e6963.vhd
/root/Documents/HTB/Bastion/smb/vhd_mount/`

In this way we create a device vhd1 in the selected folder, creating a Boot-Sector for mounitng the
Windows Image Disk. At this step , simply trying to mount the device returns an error, declaring that
NTFS signature is missing.
Analysing the vhdi1 using mmls shows that the NFS partition does not start from the beginning of the
file, but from 0000000128.

![](/images/bastion/mmls.png)

Using this information is possible to calculate the offset, which is 128*512 (sector length) = 65536.
Rewriting the commands brings to:

`mount -vt ntfs-3g -o ro,noload,offset=65536 /.vhdi1 ./backup/`

And we were able to mount the partition in the backup folder. Looking at the backup, it is clear that it
contains the whole Windows OS, including the configuration files. Indeed, it is possible to access to the
folder /Windows/System32/config and have access to SYSTEM and SAM files, which are needed in
order to dump the hashes of the users.

Using john specifying the NT format is possible to crack the password of user L4mpje.
Administrator::500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Guest::501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
L4mpje:**bureaulampje**:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:26112010952d963c8dc4217daec9
86d9:::
Using the discovered credential over ssh allows to open a session as user L4mpje, obtaining the first
flag.

# ROOT

Now we need to get superuser privileges. As first, we need to enumerate the Windows FS, searching for
interesting files. Unofrtunately the systeminfo command is denied, so I tried to access the same
information using powershell, verifying if I obtain a different result. And so it was, we were able to
identify the current OS version using Get-ComputerInfo.

In order to have a complete overview of the files and programs installed on the comuter, I also run the
Powerless [1] enumeration script. The output is present as Appendix.
Digging into the listed files, we noticed a non-standard application installed under Program Files (x86)\
mRemoteNG.
Googling it we discovered that it is a manager for remote connections for different communications
protocols [2]. So it could likely contains usefull credentials, hopefully of the Administrator user,
granting us full control over the box. Further researching for possible ways to recovery the password, I
found an interesting article [3]. Despite it proposes three different ways in order to recover it, the only
one actually working for me is the first one, which involves installing mRemoteNG in a Windows
system.
The file which contains the credential we are searching for is under Users\L4mpje\AppData\Roaming\
mRemoteNG\confCons.xml which contains two nodes, so probably, two encrypted credentials.

After having started a Windows VM and having installed mRemoteNG on it, I modified the
confCons.xml file in order to set a blank password for opening the file and loaded it using mRemoteNG
on my VM. The file is successfully loaded and the program shows two connectins : DC and L4mpje.
Using the password lookup tool of mRemoteNg, we are able to check the credentials of both user,
finding a new password.

Providing this as password for user Administrator over ssh opens up an ssh session, so are have finally
owned the box. We can take the last flag and say bye bye to Bastion :P
